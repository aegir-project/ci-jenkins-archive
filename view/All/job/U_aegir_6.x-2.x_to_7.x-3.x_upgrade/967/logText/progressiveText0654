==> Aegir 7.x-3.x automated upgrade script
==> This script makes the following assumptions: 
 * you have read http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/upgrade/ and have prepared the server accordingly
 * you are executing this script as your "aegir" user
 * that the following settings are correct

The Aegir version to upgrade to is 7.x-3.x
The Aegir home dir is /var/aegir
The new hostmaster platform will be /var/aegir/hostmaster-7.x-3.x-2017-03-31-0323
Your Aegir domain is aegir2to3-dev.test
Your old hostmaster platform was /var/aegir/hostmaster-6.x-2.x
The Drush command is "drush"
Drush will not be upgraded as its directory is not writable: /usr/share/drush

This command will operate the following changes in your system:

1. verify the server and the hostmaster site (provision-verify)
2. verify the new platform (which will download it if missing)
3. stop the queue (hosting-pause)
4. attempt a migration to the new platform (provision-migrate)
5. start the queue (hosting-resume)

               should go first so that other modules can alter its output       
               during hook_page_alter(). Almost everything on the page is a     
               block,  so before block module runs, there will not be much to   
               alter.                                                           
 Block   7002  Rename {blocks} table to {block}, {blocks_roles} to {block_role}

 Filter  7003  Upgrade the {filter} table for core filters.                     
 Filter  7005  Integrate text formats with the user permissions system.   This  
               function converts text format role assignments to use the new    
               text  format permissions introduced in Drupal 7, creates a       
               fallback (plain text)  format that is available to all users,    
               and explicitly sets the text format  in cases that used to rely  
               on a single site-wide default.                                   
 Filter  7008  Grant usage of all text formats to user roles having the

 Node    7013  Change {node}.vid default value from 0 to NULL to avoid deadlock 
               issues on MySQL.

 User    7003  Update user settings for cancelling user accounts.   Prior to    
               7.x, users were not able to cancel their accounts. When          
               administrators deleted an account, all contents were assigned to 
               uid 0,  which is the same as the 'user_cancel_reassign' method   
               now.

 User    7009  Converts fields that store serialized variables from text to     
               blob.

               updating email templates to use the new  tokens,                 
               user_update_7017() now targets email templates of Drupal 6 sites 
               and  already upgraded sites.

               Drupal 7, this permission has been renamed to 'skip comment      
               approval'.

               a warning to users that they may need to go and modify the

               {node_revision} table.                                           
 Node    7007  Remove column min_word_count.                                    
 Node    7008  Split the 'administer nodes' permission from 'access content     
               overview'.                                                       
 Node    7009  Convert node languages from the empty string to LANGUAGE_NONE.   
 Node    7010  Add the {block_node_type} table.                                 
 Node    7011  Update the database from Drupal 6 to match the schema.           
 Node    7012  Switches body fields to untranslatable while upgrading from D6   
               and makes them language neutral.                                 
 Node    7013  Change {node}.vid default value from 0 to NULL to avoid deadlock 
               issues on MySQL.                                                 
 Node    7014  Add an index on {node}.language.                                 
 Node    7015  Enable node types that may have been erroneously disabled in     
               Drupal 7.36.                                                     
 Node    7016  Change {history}.nid to an unsigned int in order to match        
               {node}.nid.                                                      
 Taxono  7001  Rename taxonomy tables.                                          
 my                                                                             
 Taxono  7002  Add {vocabulary}.machine_name column.                            
 my                                                                             
 Taxono  7003  Remove the related terms setting from vocabularies.   This       
 my            setting has not been used since Drupal 6. The                    
               {taxonomy_relations} table  itself is retained to allow for data 
               to be upgraded.                                                  
 Taxono  7004  Move taxonomy vocabulary associations for nodes to fields and    
 my            field instances.                                                 
 Taxono  7005  Migrate {taxonomy_term_node} table to field storage.   @todo:    
 my            This function can possibly be made much faster by wrapping a     
               transaction around all the inserts.                              
 Taxono  7006  Add {taxonomy_term_data}.format column.                          
 my                                                                             
 Taxono  7007  Add index on {taxonomy_term_data}.name column to speed up        
 my            taxonomy_get_term_by_name().                                     
 Taxono  7008  Change the weight columns to normal int.                         
 my                                                                             
 Taxono  7009  Change {taxonomy_term_data}.format into varchar.                 
 my                                                                             
 Taxono  7010  Change {taxonomy_index}.created to support signed int.           
 my                                                                             
 Taxono  7011  Drop unpublished nodes from the index.                           
 my                                                                             
 User    7000  Increase the length of the password field to accommodate better  
               hashes.   Also re-hashes all current passwords to improve        
               security. This may be a  lengthy process, and is performed       
               batch-wise.                                                      
 User    7001  Remove the 'threshold', 'mode' and 'sort' columns from the       
               {users} table.   These fields were previously used to store      
               per-user comment settings.                                       
 User    7002  Convert user time zones from time zone offsets to time zone      
               names.                                                           
 User    7003  Update user settings for cancelling user accounts.   Prior to    
               7.x, users were not able to cancel their accounts. When          
               administrators deleted an account, all contents were assigned to 
               uid 0,  which is the same as the 'user_cancel_reassign' method   
               now.                                                             
 User    7005  Changes the users table to allow longer e-mail addresses.        
 User    7006  Add module data to {role_permission}.                            
 User    7007  Add a weight column to user roles.                               
 User    7008  If 'user_register' variable was unset in Drupal 6, set it to be  
               the same as  the Drupal 6 default setting.                       
 User    7009  Converts fields that store serialized variables from text to     
               blob.                                                            
 User    7010  Update the {user}.signature_format column.                       
 User    7011  Placeholder function.   As a fix for user_update_7011() not      
               updating email templates to use the new  tokens,                 
               user_update_7017() now targets email templates of Drupal 6 sites 
               and  already upgraded sites.                                     
 User    7012  Add the user's pictures to the {file_managed} table and make     
               them managed  files.                                             
 User    7013  Add user module file usage entries.                              
 User    7014  Rename the 'post comments without approval' permission.   In     
               Drupal 7, this permission has been renamed to 'skip comment      
               approval'.                                                       
 User    7015  Change {users}.signature_format into varchar.                    
 User    7016  Update the database to match the schema.                         
 User    7017  Update email templates to use new tokens.   This function        
               upgrades customized email templates from the old !token format   
               to the new core tokens format. Additionally, in Drupal 7 we no   
               longer e-mail  plain text passwords to users, and there is no    
               token for a plain text  password in the new token system.        
               Therefore, it also modifies any saved  templates using the old   
               '!password' token such that the token is removed, and  displays  
               a warning to users that they may need to go and modify the       
               wording  of their templates.                                     
 User    7018  Ensure there is an index on {users}.picture.                     
 User    7019  Ensure there is a combined index on {authmap}.uid and            
               {authmap}.module.
