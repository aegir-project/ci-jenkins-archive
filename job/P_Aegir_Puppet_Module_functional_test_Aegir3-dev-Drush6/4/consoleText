A Vagrant 1.0.x state file was found for this environment. Vagrant has
gone ahead and auto-upgraded this to the latest format. Everything
should continue working as normal. Beware, however, that older versions
of Vagrant may no longer be used with this environment.

However, in case anything went wrong, the old dotfile was backed up
to the location below. If everything is okay, it is safe to remove
this backup.

The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

puppet apply --modulepath '/tmp/vagrant-puppet-2/modules-0:/etc/puppet/modules' --color=false --manifestdir /tmp/vagrant-puppet-2/manifests --detailed-exitcodes /tmp/vagrant-puppet-2/manifests/nodes.pp

Stdout from the command:

warning: Could not retrieve fact fqdn
warning: Host is missing hostname and/or domain: aegir3-dev
warning: Host is missing hostname and/or domain: aegir3-dev


Stderr from the command:

stdin: is not a tty
Could not find default node or by name with 'aegir3-dev' on node aegir3-dev
'vagrant up' failed. Leaving vm in place for forensic analysis.
